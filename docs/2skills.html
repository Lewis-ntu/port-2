									<p>For a portfolio like one outlined in Career aspirationsit will require projects with quality well documented code and professionally written analysis of the components of a system. I have a high level of proficiency in the programming language python.</p>
									<p>For A-level computer science I had to develop a project that would be assessed through documentation and through a developed program, I used Pygame to develop a game as I believed that it would efectively show concurrency within the program. Overall I was proud of this project and received an A* for my efforts and I think it presents my strengths in python programming and documentation.</p>
									<p>In the systems analysis and design module I had create a project with a group of my peers of a proposal for a system for a jobseekers company to help match employers and jobseekers, Our team had clear communication and used Microsoft teams to organise our efforts and for this project we received a grade of a low first which I am pleased with though I recognise there was things we could've developed further to achieve a higher grade.</p>
